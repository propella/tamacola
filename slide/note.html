<h4>Intro</h4>

<p>I have published the source code of Tamacola, a lisp compiler which
runs on Adobe Flash / Tamarin VM (or Adobe Virtual Machine 2) <a
href="http://github.com/propella/tamacola">http://github.com/propella/tamacola</a>. I'm
pretty sure that the current version is useless if you are just
looking for a lisp implementation on Tamarin (las3r and scheme-abc are
much better), but Tamacola includes abundant tips if you are
interested in making a self-hosting compiler on Tamarin VM. That's why
I decided to publish it as-is.</p>

<p>I'm also working on a presentation slide for S3 conference
<a href="http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/s3/s3-10/">http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/s3/s3-10/</a> to show it. I'm writing
random thoughts about the compiler here so that I will compile them to
a thread of talk.</p>

<p>I've already written the motivation on the paper (perhaps I will paste
the URL in a month) so I don't repeat it. But in short, I wanted make
a tiny language which bootstraps and runs on Adobe Flash.</p>

<p>A tiny language and bootstrapping seem contradicting idea as
bootstrapping requires various language functions which tends to be
large. On the other hand, this is practically a nice constrain because
it keeps the language from too simple or too fat. Choosing Scheme like
language as a target is natural to me because I wanted to concentrate
basic implementation technique instead of language design.</p>

<p>Well, as one reviewer of the paper said, this is not particularly
surprising or dramatically different in comparison with previous
systems in the area, but some of the stories from the compiler should
interest you!</p>

<h4>How I started the assembler</h4>

<p>In the beginning I created the assembler. Honestly, I wanted to avoid
the task because writing assembler seemed not quite an interesting
job. But in that time, I couldn't find a nice AVM2 assembler that
suite my project. So I've done it. In retrospect, this was not bad at
all. I could understand what avm2overview.pdf (the AVM2 specification)
said quite well, and I got self confidence.</p>

<p>I wrote my assembler in PLT-Scheme because Ian Piumarta's COLA
(Tamacola was supposed to be written in COLA and Tamacola itself, I'll
tell you this later) is not finished yet in that time and Duncan Mak,
a friend of mine, recommend it. This was actually a good choice. This
is my first Scheme application and PLT's good documentation helped me
a lot.</p>

<p>An interesting part of PLT-Scheme was it encourages a functional
programming style, even PLT doesn't suppport set-car! and set-cdr! in
the default library. So it was natural that my assembler was written
without side-effect except I/O. This is the first key of the
development of the assembler. Unfortunately, because Tamarin doesn't
support tail-recursion optimazion and Tamarin's stack size is small, I
gave up to eliminate all side-effect later. But the implementation was
pure functional up to the time, and it was quite clean.</p>

<p>Indeed, it had to be clean considering boot-strapping. I wanted to
make the assembler run in my language itself even before enough
debugging facility is not ready. If it were not clean, a tiny bug
would cause a few days of debugging. I avoided the nightmare with a
functional style and Test Driven Development.</p>

<p>Test Driven Development is the second key. I virtually wrote every
test case for each function even if it looks silly. Scheme has a
couple of options of testing frame work. I chose SRFI-78. It only
report assertion failer only something happen, otherwise it keeps
silence. I somewhat like this UNIX taste terse.</p>

<p>The third key was to write an assembler and a disassembler in a same
time. It sounds like an unnecessary job because I only needed an
assembler eventually. But I had to analyze an output from asc (an
asembler in Adobe Flex) and learn how an ActionScript program was
converted to the Tamarin byte-code. The disassembler was very helpful
to read the byte-code as well as debugging. If output of the
disassembler generates the original byte-code by the assembler, there
is high chance that my imprementation is correct, unless my
understanding is wrong.</p>

<p>The assembler is named ABCSX <a
href="http://github.com/propella/abcsx">http://github.com/propella/abcsx</a>
and it was ported to Gauche, COLA, and Tamacola later. I ported it to
Gauche because I was curious about portability of Scheme language.</p>

<p>I had realized there are many places where I could reduce code
redundancy in the assembler. An assembler tends to include repetitive
process, but some of them are not quite captured well by function
abstraction. I would be effective to apply macro and domain specific
language in those part. I didn't have tried to solve it yet, but I
want to solve it later.</p>

<p>(to be continued)</p>




<h3>Tamacola (2)</h3>

<h4>COLA</h4>

<p>Once the assembler was done, I was able to test verious Tamarin VM's
features, even I wrote a tiny GUI application on Adobe Flash in the
assembler. Then next step is the compiler.</p>

<p>Another goal of the project was to port Ian Piumarta's COLA framework
to Tamarin (the project name came from this). And perhaps this is only
the real technical contribution of the project. COLA is a meta
language (a programming language to design another language) which
resembles Scheme. COLA has a nice sub-language called Parser
Expression Grammar that makes parser very terse. My plan was to write
a boot-strappng compiler in PEG and COLA, then to implement COLA
library, and to write the real compiler in PEG and Tamacola itself.</p>

<p>I won't give you the detail of PEG. But briefly, it is as simple as a
regular expression and as powerful as a context free grammar.</p>

<p>When that time I started writing the compiler, COLA has no library at
all except PEG framework, so I needed to write necessary libraries by
myself from scratch. Fortunately COLA has quite a powerful external
function call feature (a kind of FFI), macro sysytem, and a flexible
object oriented framework. So writing library is not so hard. But I
tried not to use COLA specific features as possible because it would
be a problem when I rewrite the compiler in Tamacola itself later.</p>

<p>To implement the library, I borrowed function specifications from R6RS
as well as possible to avoid unnecessary confusion. There were
exception because COLA treat a slash "/" character as special for
namespaces, I took PLT's function names in this case.</p>

<p>Writing lisp libraries is interesting puzzle to me because there were
some requirements and constrain for the domain. Those requiments are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit testing framework.</li>
<li>Library framework.</li>
<li>List manipulations.</li>
<li>String functions.</li>
<li>Bit operations and streams.</li>
<li>Pretty printer for debugging.</li>
</ul>

<p>These requirements were carefully chosen. Because COLA has only modest
debugging facility, the unit test framework must be there. So my first
goal was to implement all functions needed by the unit testing. I
needed a pretty printer for debugging, too.</p>

<p>Another "must have" library was bit operators, and file / in-memory
streams that is needed to the assembler. Interestingly enough, R6RS
doesn't define enough functions to support those. For example, there
are no portable way to specify a stream to be binary or text. So I
needed a bit creativity.</p>

<p>Eventually, I wrote all libraries and the compiler. And I got a pretty
good sense about a minimun set of functions needed for compiler, which
are testing framework, pretty printer, bit operators, and streams. In
other words, if your language has those features, your language can be
self-hosting.</p>

<p>The real puzzle part was the order. Those requirements must be
precisely ordered by need. For example, the pretty printer must follow
stream and string functions because the pretty printer uses those
functions. Although you can write functions in random order as you
like in Lisp, precise order makes testing and debugging is easy.  I
kept this discipline.  I even implemented the test library twice, the
first one was concise assert function, and the second one has more
friendly fail message by the pretty printer.</p>

<p>It took a few weeks to build a simple compiler, but still there were
long way up to the point where self-hosting can be done. One thing
that I had learned from the stage was, even without debugger,
debugging is not so hard if you have enough test cases and a good
pretty printer.</p>

<h4>How a lisp program is compiled to Tamarin VM</h4>

<p>Now I'm going to talk a bit about how a lisp (almost Scheme) program
is compiled into Tamarin's byte code. This topic is especially
interesting if you are curious to make your own language or VM.</p>

<p>Tamarin VM is made for ActionScript, so its byte code is also
specifically designed for ActionScript. In other words, it is a
slightly tricky to implement other language than ActionScript.  In
case if you don't know about ActionScript, it is almost identical as
JavaScript in the execution model. Difference between them is about
optimization with explicit type notion and static field.</p>

<p>ActionScript and Scheme are common for those aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lexical scope.</li>
<li>Function object.</li>
<li>Variable arguments with no curring.</li>
<li>Dynamic typing (a value has type, not variable).</li>
</ul>

<p>But there are significant difference.</p>

<ul>
<li>ActionScript doesn't have a simple function call. Everything is a method call.</li>
<li>In ActionScript, a function has a scope. No scope block or let expression.</li>
<li>Tail call optimization is not supported.</li>
<li>Call stack can not be accessed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those limitations sound like that Tamarin VM is inferior. But no,
actually those limitations come from Tamarin VM's advantage and
optimization.  If you happen to have a chance to design your VM, please
learn from the lesson. There ain't no such thing as a free
optimization. Any optimization kills some generality. I'll explain each
case.</p>

<p>ActionScript doesn't have a simple function call neither Tamarin
VM. This is rather harmless though. When you see a function like
expression like <code>trace("hello")</code>, this is actually mean
<code>(the global object).trace("hello")</code>, and eventually, the
receiver passes to the function as the first argument. In other words,
if you want to construct a function call with two arguments, you need
to make three arguments where the first argument is "this" object.  A
slightly tricky part is primitive operators like + or -, which don't
have "this" object. Those primitives are special case.</p>
 
<p>ActionScript also has lexical scope, but only a function has a
scope. So I have to be careful when I compile let expression in
Scheme. Most simplest way to implement a let expression is to use a
function. A let expression can be always translated to a lambda in
theory though, this is a huge performance disadvantage. So I use
"with" expression in ActionScript. "With" expression is an unpopular
syntax in ActionScript, but you can use any object as a scope
object. I borrowed this idea from Happy-ABC project <a
href="http://github.com/mzp/scheme-abc">http://github.com/mzp/scheme-abc</a>.</p>

<p>Lack of the tail call optimization in Tamarin VM was the most
disappointed thing to me. It prevents a functional programming
style. I simply gave up it. Tail call optimization is not difficult
topic at all. If the target were a native code like x86, it would be a
matter of swapping stack and jump. But Tamarin VM doesn't allow direct
access of stack or jump to other function. I understand that it might
cause a security issue though, it would be wonderful if VM would provide
special byte code for tail call.</p>

<p>Finally, you can't access the call stack directly, therefore you can't
implement call/cc.  The reason why I can't call Tamacola as Scheme is
the lack of tail call optimization and call/cc. It prevents many
experimental language features like generator, process, or so. But
considering rich libraries provided by the Flash API, I would say
Tamacola will be a reasonably useful language eventually.</p>

<p>I'll tell you convolved self hosting process and macros tomorrow.</p>










<h3>Tamacola (4)</h3>

<h4>Tamacola in Tamacola</h4>

<p>After I made the Tamacola compiler written in COLA, next thing to do
was to implement it in Tamacola itself. A language is called
self-hosting if the language is written in the language itself. This
implies various advantage.</p>

<p>First, once self-hosting is done, you don't need to use COLA anymore,
you can improve or modify any language aspects on Tamarin VM. If I
carefully design the environment, it would be possible to do language
design only on the Web browser (it needs server side help for security
reason, so it hasn't done yet).</p>

<p>Second, self hosting is a benchmark for the language to tell that it
is good enough. Scheme is especially simple language, so there are a
lot of people who implement toy-Scheme. But because my Tamacola is now
self-hosting, I could proudly claim that this is not a toy! Well, this
is rather self satisfaction, though.</p>

<p>Third, it provides a rich library including "eval" function. A
compiler uses various programming techniques, and those must be useful
for other programs, too.</p>

<p>To make it self-hosting, there were two key problem which are macros
and eval.</p>

<h4>Bootstrapping Macros</h4>

<p>I heavily used macros in my compiler, for example, the parser written
in PEG was converted a bunch of macro expressions. The problem is,
expanding macros requires eval function but I wasn't able to make eval
before the parser was done. It's a deadlock! Here is a typical macro
written in COLA:</p>

<pre>
(define-form begin e (cons 'let (cons '() e)))
</pre>

This is how the macro works. When the compiler find a expression like:

<pre>
(begin
  (print "Hello")
  (print "World"))
</pre>

Expressions inside <code>begin</code> is bound to <code>e</code>, the
body <code>(cons 'let (cons '() e))</code> is executed in compile time
and the expression is expanded to:

<pre>
(let ()
  (print "Hello")
  (print "World"))
</pre>

<p>Such expansion is impossible without eval function because the
compiler need to evaluate a list <code>(cons 'let (cons '() e))</code>
given by user. What I would do when I didn't have eval yet.  But I
realized that macros only include basic list functions like car, cdr,
and cons in many cases. And a more complicated macro could be hard
corded as a special form in the compiler. So I invented a pattern base
macros.</p>

<pre>
(define-pattern ((begin . e) (let () . e)))
</pre>

<p>Basically this is a subset of Scheme's syntax-rule. If the compiler
finds an expression starting with <code>begin</code>, rest of the
expression is bound to <code>e</code> and substituted as a right hand
side. Those expansion requires only limited set of list functions, so
the compiler doesn't have to provide full eval function. This macro
syntax made my compiler readable, and I was able to continue happily.</p>

<p>Even after I implemented more dynamic traditional macro with eval
function, I keep using this pattern base macros mainly.</p>

<h4>Eval</h4>

<p>To implement eval function, you need to understand the dynamic code
loading facility provided by the VM. Note that this is not part of
AVM2 specification, and Avmshell (a console Tamarin shell program) and
Adobe Flash have different API.</p>

<p>Avmshell has straightforward API. You give compiled byte code, and the
function returns the value. Because Tamacola is now written in
Tamacola, you can invoke the compiler as a library function and get
byte code you want to execute.</p>

<pre>
avmplus.Domain.loadBytes(byteArray:ByteArray)
</pre>

<p>You can get the domain object by Domain.currentDomain() static method.
Those useful functions in Avmshell are found <code>shell/</code>
directory in the Tamarin-central repository.</p>

<p>Flash Player has somewhat tricky API for dynamic code loading. The
signature is normal.</p>

<pre>
flash.display.Loader.loadBytes(bytes:ByteArray, context:LoaderContext = null):void
</pre>

<p>There are two problems for our purpose. First, this method is not
designed mainly for dynamic loading, it only accepts SWF, JPG, PNG, or
GIF files, and byte code happen to be accepted inside a SWF file. So I
had to construct SWF file to load code. In case if you don't know
about SWF file, SWF file is a kind of container format. You can
embedded vector graphics, mp3 sounds, and ActionScript byte
code. Making a SWF file is not particularly difficult though, it needs
nasty bit fiddling.</p>

<p>Second, this is far more problematic, is that this method works as
asynchronously. In other words, this doesn't return the result
value. Instead, you need to give it a callback function to wait to
finish the code. Additionally, this method doesn't return value at
all, so if you want the return value, you need to setup some explicit
return mechanism by yourself.</p>

<p>Practically, this cause a problem if you want to write a traditional
macro definition and use the macro in a same source code. Because a
traditional macro need to evaluate a lisp expression in a compile
time, but the eval function doesn't return before the compilation
thread is done. I could solve the problem by setting up compilation
queue or something, but it would cost performance penalty which I
don't want. And now I simply gave up.</p>

<p>I have explained pretty much all interesting aspect of the self
hosting compiler. I'll talk about how to make a new language on the
Tamacola environment later.</p>
